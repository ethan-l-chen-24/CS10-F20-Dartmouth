# CS10-F20-Dartmouth
Contains each of the 6 problem sets in Dartmouth's CS10: Problem Solving via Object-Oriented Programming

### Problem Set 1 - CamPaint
This program assigns a certain color and makes the largest webcam region that matches that color a “paintbrush”.

### Problem Set 2 - PointQuadTree and Collision Detector
This problem set introduces the QuadTree data structure (a binary tree with four children instead of two) in which children are assigned specific quadrants with respect to their parent. Using this program, we can efficiently find points within a specified region, as well as record collisions between moving objects.

### Problem Set 3 - Huffman Encoding Algorithm
The Huffman encoding algorithm turns a Unicode character into an associated, unique stream of bits. This allows for easy compression and decompression of text files.

### Problem Set 4 - Kevin Bacon Game
The Kevin Bacon game loads data from a master set of thousands of actors and what movies they have starred in. The game then uses a breadth-first search to find the “Kevin-Bacon-Number”, or the shortest path from one actor to another via the movies they have starred in together. This code includes a console-based UI.

### Problem Set 5 - Viterbi Algorithm and POS Tagging
Using the Viterbi Algorithm, this program predicts the grammatical parts of speech associated with each word in an inputted sentence.

### Problem Set 6 - Collaborative Graphical Editor
This program allows the ability to concurrently run several “editors” on a “sketch server”, such that each editor can collaboratively work on a drawing of ellipses, rectangles, lines, and scribbles. Each action is synchronized such that every editor always sees the same sketch.
